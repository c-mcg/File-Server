## Coding conventions

# Whole project
  * Indent 4 tabs
  * Space out blocks of code and group lines with similar functionality
  * Attempt to write a short comment on each block of code
  * A good example of this can be found at `src/file_server/file/__test__/test_snapshot.py`

# Back End (Python)
  * Variables, functions, and methods should be named with underscores between words. E.g `example_var`
  * Classes should be named with upper camel case. E.g `ExampleClass`
